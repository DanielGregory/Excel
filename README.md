# 📈 Stock Trading AI & Mortgage Data Projects – Model Files

This repository contains Excel files used in two separate projects:

1. **AI-based Stock Trading System**  
2. **Mortgage Data Analysis Project**

## 📁 File Descriptions

### 🧠 Stock Trading AI (Main Project)

These files were used for model evaluation and analysis across different machine learning strategies:

- **AI-Example.xlsx**  
  Contains results and configuration logs from the **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** model used for sequential trade decision-making.

- **S&P500_RNN_3-27-25_500.xlsx**  
  Includes input/output data and time-series predictions from the **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** model trained on S&P 500 data.

- **Model_50_3-27-25_para.xlsx**  
  Logs parameters and predictions from the **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)** model (Model 50), optimized for high-speed trade signal generation.

### 🏡 Mortgage Data Analysis

- **Home Mortgage Loans.xlsx**  
  Dataset used for a separate **Excel-based data analysis project** that explored mortgage loan trends, borrower risk profiles, and lending patterns.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- **Stock Trading AI**: Develop, compare, and tune real-time trading models using historical and real-time market data.
- **Mortgage Trends**: Analyze structured mortgage loan data to uncover patterns in approval rates, loan sizes, and regional variation.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Excel**: Data entry, tracking, result aggregation
- **Python**: Core model development (for AI project)
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `NumPy` (Stock AI only)
